# Test Hybrid Option 4 Script

echo "ðŸ§ª TESTING HYBRID OPTION 4"
echo "========================="
echo ""

echo "âœ… HYBRID APPROACH COMBINES:"
echo "â€¢ Option 1: Web-based GUI (buildx) - WORKS"
echo "â€¢ Option 3: Hybrid setup - WORKS"
echo "â€¢ Docker Compose orchestration - NEW"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ“‹ WHAT OPTION 4 NOW DOES:"
echo "1. Installs Python dependencies (distutils, setuptools)"
echo "2. Installs Docker Compose via pip (most reliable)"
echo "3. Uses Option 1's working webgui installation"
echo "4. Creates Docker Compose configuration"
echo "5. Creates startup script"
echo ""

echo "ðŸŽ¯ EXPECTED RESULT:"
echo "â€¢ Python dependencies: âœ…"
echo "â€¢ Docker Compose: âœ…"
echo "â€¢ Web GUI build: âœ… (using working Option 1 approach)"
echo "â€¢ Docker Compose orchestration: âœ…"
echo "â€¢ Services start: âœ…"
echo ""

echo "ðŸš€ TEST STEPS:"
echo "1. Run: ./install_redline_fixed.sh"
echo "2. Choose option 4"
echo "3. Wait for installation"
echo "4. Run: ./start_compose.sh"
echo "5. Access: http://localhost:8080 and http://localhost:6080"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ”§ IF IT FAILS:"
echo "â€¢ Check: ./test_docker_compose_install.sh"
echo "â€¢ Check logs: docker-compose logs"
echo "â€¢ Fallback: Use Option 1 (webgui) or Option 3 (hybrid)"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ’¡ HYBRID BENEFITS:"
echo "â€¢ Uses proven working components"
echo "â€¢ Adds Docker Compose orchestration"
echo "â€¢ Better resource management"
echo "â€¢ Easier service management"
echo "â€¢ Professional deployment approach"
