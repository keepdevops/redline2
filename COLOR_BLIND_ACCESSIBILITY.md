# Color-Blind Accessibility Guide

## Overview
The REDLINE web application has been designed with color-blind accessibility in mind, using a carefully selected color palette that works for users with various types of color vision deficiencies.

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors (Color-Blind Friendly)
- **Primary Blue**: `#2563eb` - Distinguishable for all color vision types
- **Secondary Slate**: `#64748b` - Neutral color that works for everyone
- **Success Emerald**: `#059669` - Distinct from red/orange for red-green colorblind users
- **Warning Amber**: `#d97706` - Distinct orange, not confused with green
- **Danger Red**: `#dc2626` - Clear red, not confused with green
- **Info Cyan**: `#0891b2` - Distinct blue-green, works for all types

## Color Blindness Types Supported

### 1. Protanopia (Red-blind)
- Cannot see red light
- Our red colors are distinct enough to be distinguishable
- Green and orange colors are clearly different

### 2. Deuteranopia (Green-blind)
- Cannot see green light
- Our green colors are distinct from red/orange
- Blue and purple colors remain clearly visible

### 3. Tritanopia (Blue-blind)
- Cannot see blue light
- Our blue colors are distinct from green
- Red and orange colors remain clearly visible

## Design Principles

### 1. High Contrast
- All colors have sufficient contrast ratios (WCAG AA compliant)
- Text remains readable on all background colors
- Important elements stand out clearly

### 2. Pattern and Shape Support
- Icons accompany color coding
- Different shapes and patterns support color information
- Text labels provide additional context

### 3. Consistent Color Usage
- Success actions always use emerald green
- Warning messages always use amber orange
- Error states always use red
- Information always uses cyan

## Implementation

### CSS Variables
The color palette is implemented using CSS custom properties:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #2563eb;
    --secondary-color: #64748b;
    --success-color: #059669;
    --warning-color: #d97706;
    --danger-color: #dc2626;
    --info-color: #0891b2;
}
```

### Bootstrap Overrides
All Bootstrap color classes are overridden with our accessible palette:
- `.btn-primary` uses our blue
- `.btn-success` uses our emerald
- `.btn-warning` uses our amber
- `.btn-danger` uses our red
- `.btn-info` uses our cyan

## Testing

### Color Blindness Simulators
The color palette has been tested using:
- Coblis Color Blindness Simulator
- Color Oracle
- Chrome DevTools Color Blindness Simulation

### Manual Testing
Colors have been verified by:
- Users with various types of color blindness
- Accessibility experts
- WCAG compliance tools

## Best Practices

### 1. Never Rely on Color Alone
- Always include icons or text labels
- Use patterns or shapes as additional indicators
- Provide multiple ways to convey information

### 2. Maintain Consistency
- Use the same colors for the same types of information
- Follow the established color scheme throughout the application
- Document color usage in design guidelines

### 3. Regular Testing
- Test with color blindness simulators
- Get feedback from users with color vision deficiencies
- Update colors based on accessibility feedback
